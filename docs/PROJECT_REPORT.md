### Design Decisions Analysis

#### ‚úÖ Good Design Decisions

**1. Technology Stack Selection:**
- **Next.js 15 + App Router:** Modern, performant framework with excellent developer experience
- **TypeScript:** Provides compile-time type checking and better IDE support
- **tRPC:** Type-safe API layer eliminates common API-related bugs
- **Drizzle ORM:** Type-safe database operations with excellent developer experience
- **Tailwind + Radix UI:** Consistent, accessible component system

**2. Modular Architecture:**
- Feature-based code organization (`src/modules/`)
- Clear separation of concerns (UI, server logic, database)
- Reusable component library structure
- Well-defined API boundaries

**3. External Service Integration:**
- Proper abstraction of third-party services
- Webhook-based event handling for real-time updates
- Graceful error handling for external service failures

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Questionable Design Decisions

**1. Component Naming Inconsistencies:**
- Mixed naming conventions (`componenets` vs `components`)
- Inconsistent file naming patterns
- **Impact:** Reduces code readability and maintainability

**2. Database Schema Design:**
- Meeting status as enum is good, but limited flexibility
- No soft deletes or audit trails
- **Recommendation:** Consider adding `deletedAt` fields for data recovery

**3. Error Handling:**
- Inconsistent error handling patterns across modules
- Some endpoints lack proper validation
- **Impact:** Poor user experience during failures

#### ‚ùå Poor Design Decisions

**1. Code Comments and Dead Code:**
- Extensive commented-out code blocks
- TODO comments without implementation
- **Impact:** Code clutter, confusion for new developers

**2. Function Complexity:**
- Some functions exceed 100+ lines (e.g., webhook handler)
- Mixed responsibilities within single functions
- **Impact:** Difficult to test and maintain

**3. Missing Abstractions:**
- Direct database queries in API routes
- Repeated patterns without shared utilities
- **Impact:** Code duplication and maintenance burden
